# Hybrid_Image
In this small project we try to implement a hybrid image based on `Img1.jpg` and `Img2.jpg`.

How to use
----------
For the sake of Warping `Img2.jpg` on `Img1.jpg`, the user need to chose corresponding points between two images that are shown automatically on the screen. Moreover, the corresponding points should be chosen in a particular order. In the image below shows the corresponding points chosen by user:
